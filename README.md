# Solutions for Advent of Code
Note that I did not care that much about readability and performance of my code. 
This is due to tha fact that the goal of AoC is to get the solution fast.

Nevertheless, I added some comments in order to make it easier to understand what I did.
## Currently the follwing puzzles are solved
